In March, DJI was accused of limiting the capabilities of drones used by the Ukrainian military (see  Newsletter 11  ) and, later that month, German electronics retailer MediaMarkt removed DJI drone from its stores (see  Newsletter 12  ). Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal  reports  that Ukrainian soldiers have been told not to connect DJI drones to Wi-Fi or mobile networks, and that US drone manufacturers are stepping in to fill Ukrainian military requirements for small commercial drones. Federal Communications Commissioner Brendan Carr, commenting on the controversy, stated that, \"Reports about DJI drones being used by the Russian military in Ukraine only underscore the need for the US to adopt a clear and consistent response to the potentially serious national security threats posed by this Chinese drone maker.\"  [3]')\n",

', ' ', 'The Global Times, a widely read subsidiary of thePeople\\'s Daily with a strong nationalist bent, published an op-ed by Senior Colonel Li Minghai, a professor at the PLA NDU National Security College War and Crisis Response Training Center, claiming that cognitive warfare is the \"essence\" of the confrontation between Russia and Ukraine.  [4] \\nCognitive domain operations, according to Li, use neuroscience, new information technologies (such as big data and AI), and mass communication channels and platforms to execute cyber, psychological, public opinion, legal, and other forms of information warfare across the conflict continuum and at all levels of war. Li argues that these operations influence opponents\\' thought processes and ideology through disseminating propaganda, indoctrinating populations, and infiltrating their culture and value systems. Li asserts that this \"mind war\" weaponizes language and ideas to \"affect targets\\' cognition,\" influence their pursuit of their military and political objectives, and \"change their decision-making and behavior.\"\\nLi alleges that Russia, Ukraine, and Western countries have effectively exploited the world\\'s growing reliance on communications technologies and platforms to sway domestic and international support for their respective aims. According to Li, these states have accomplished this exploitation by selectively releasing key leadership statements and information-along with disinformation and misinformation-about the war, particularly in audio-visual formats, on global social media platforms. To illustrate his point  , Li summarizes key statements that Vladimir Putin, Volodymyr Zelensky, and other global leaders have issued to muster their citizens\\' support and the support of other countries for their respective sides of the conflict. \\nFuture Warfare\\nPLA Daily article discusses seven trends of intelligent warfare.

These operations will integrate traditional military operations with economic warfare, diplomatic warfare, cyber warfare, public opinion warfare, psychological warfare, and legal warfare.')\n",
      "(' Trend 7: From \"practical test\" to \"experimental exercise.\" ', ' ', 'According to the article, the use of advanced virtual reality will allow militaries to train under a variety of simulated conditions that may be superior in some ways to real-world training and exercising.

The use of AI-enabled battle management systems will allow for improved cross-domain operations as communications and data collected from different domains will be fused and disseminated more effectively.

The article states, \"There is no doubt that if troops can be subjected to such an environment and conditions, their level of combat and combat capabilities will be greatly enhanced and strengthened.\" Because of the newness of the metaverse, the article argues that it should be developed incrementally to take into account the changing nature of war as well as military strategy, existing conditions, and future requirements that create realistic scenarios conducted at simulated training bases that will give military personnel an immersive experience that will accurately reflect the \"nature, fierceness, and cruelty of future war.\"')\n",

The ultimate goal of cognitive war is to destroy the \"spiritual core of the enemy\\'s personnel\" either to prevent war or limit its scope. Cognitive warfare operations are aided by analysis of the target\\'s politics, military, cultural history, and national character so as to identify the fundamental values of the target.\\nThe article describes cognitive war as being based on changes in material conditions that are then exploited to change a human\\'s understanding of reality. In this respect, cognitive warfare will be enabled by advancements in AI-enabled weapons and their improved accuracy and lethality. The destruction wrought by these advanced weapon systems will then be quickly disseminated as credible information using AI-enabled communication, information acquisition, and dissemination technologies.\\nUnmanned Systems\\nA PLA reconnaissance company adapts tactics for combined drone-vehicle operations to improve mobility and extend the range of reconnaissance operations.

In this issue we note two of them—allegations that Russia has asked the PRC to supply drones, and accusations that a leading PRC-based commercial drone manufacturer has been limiting the technical capabilities of drones used by the Ukrainian military in order to provide an advantage to the Russian armed forces. Meanwhile, PRC media outlets have been busy reporting the highlights from this year’s National People’s Congress and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference meetings (known as the “two sessions”), including statements and proposals related to AI made by China’s political and tech leaders. Policy suggestions by delegates included advocating for a more favorable policy environment for autonomous vehicles, the development of “green AI,” government leadership in the creation of China’s metaverse, and the creation of a legal framework for UAVs in China. As expected, PRC premier Li Keqiang discussed AI in the context of the development of the PRC’s digital economy. We also cover a UAV built by a PRC research institute that reportedly set the record in China for the longest endurance capability and note that, for the first time in a phase 3 clinical trial in China, an AI chip was successfully implanted into an epilepsy patient’s brain.\\nPRC DRONES AND THE RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR\\n\\nRussia reportedly asked the PRC for drones. On March 14, CBS News reported that, according to an unnamed US official, Russia has asked the PRC to supply drones to its military. The report came amidst US government accusations that Russia has asked the PRC for economic and military support for its invasion of Ukraine. The PRC government has denied reports of the Russian request for military and economic assistance and of the PRC’s willingness to provide such support, calling them “malicious disinformation.”\")\n",

Citing sources inside Ukraine, on March 10 Volodymyr Shymanskyy, the co-founder of Blynk IoT, a software company with an office in Kyiv, accused DJI of limiting the capabilities of its AeroScope technology for the Ukrainian army. According to DJI, AeroScope technology “is able to identify the vast majority of popular drones on the market today by monitoring and analyzing their electronic signals to gain critical information.”\\nShymanskyy claimed that because DJI has allegedly limited AeroScope for the Ukrainian army, the Russian military has the technical capabilities to track Ukrainian DJI drone operators, while the Ukrainian army cannot track Russian drone operators, giving “a significant air reconnaissance edge to Russian invaders.” DJI North America responded to these claims by stating that they were false, and further explained that DJI is “aware of the problems with some AeroScope units in Ukraine” and attributed the issue to “prolonged loss of power/internet” rather than “deliberate action to downgrade AeroScope” in Ukraine.\\nTWO SESSIONS\\n\\nFrom March 4–11, the PRC held its “two sessions”—an annual event during which the National People’s Congress (NPC) and the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) conduct concurrent sessions. At the meetings, thousands of delegates discuss a wide array of topics related to the PRC’s economic development, governance, and international relations. Selected tech executives attend the NPC and CPPCC sessions—the latter body being intentionally designed to include delegates from a diversity of social and political strata in the PRC as part of the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) “united front” work.

Although an in-depth discussion on AI was not expected in this speech, Premier Li mentioned AI in relation to the development of the PRC’s digital economy.
