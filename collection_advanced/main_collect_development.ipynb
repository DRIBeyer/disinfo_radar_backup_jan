      "Stanford and Carnegie Mellon University researchers have built ObjectFolder 2.0, a dataset of 1000 3D models of objects. ObjectFolder 2.0 tries to render the objects' visual textures and material types, as well as their 3D shapes. ObjectFolder 2.0 contains 1,000 high-quality 3D objects collected from online repositories. It also ships with an \"implicit neural representation network that renders visual, acoustic, and tactile sensory data all in real-time with state-of-the-art rendering quality\". Transfer learning: The point of datasets like ObjectFolder 2.0 is to try and make it easier to do transfer learning; that is, train a robot (or other AI system) in simulation on things contained in ObjectFolder 2.0, then try and transfer those learned representations into reality. In tests, Stanford shows that systems trained on ObjectFolder 2.0 can do well at tasks like object scale estimation, tactile-audio contact localization, and visuo-tactile shape reconstruction.\n",

      "…AKA: The scaling will continue until we run out of TPUs…\n",
      "Google has trained a large language model named Pathways Language Model (PaLM). PaLM weighs in at 540 billion parameters (that'd be 10bn more parameters than Microsoft/NVIDIA's 'Turing NLG') and was trained on multiple TPU v4 pods. PaLM uses some plumbing built by Google called Pathways which makes it easier for the company to train massive models across large clusters of computers; PaLM used 6144 TPU chips, versus Gopher (4096 TPU v3 chips) or Turing NLG (2240 A100 GPUs). PaLM is also efficient, achieving a training efficiency of 57.8% hardware FLOPs utilization \"the highest yet achieved for LLMs at this scale\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Discontinuous capability jumps: One of the weird things that happens as a consequence of scaling up language models is the sudden emergence of hitherto unanticipated capabilities - here, PaLM shows dramatic improvements at things like reasoning, natural language inference, and in-context reading comprehension.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chain-of-thought = reasoning: A surprising result is that the authors use so-called chain-of-thought prompting to get the LM to show its work (e.g, rather than saying in response to 'how many apples can a door eat', 'zero', the model instead says 'zero, because doors do not eat things'). Chain-of-thought is really just a way to prompt the model to get it to output its own reasoning along with the answers - but via this simple intervention the authors show they can meaningfully improve capabilities in a whole bunch of areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "One caveat: PaLM may be an impressive achievement, but earlier this month DeepMind published a paper about a model called 'Chinchilla', where the Alphabet-subsidiary realized that it could dramatically improve LM performance by scaling data more aggressively than parameters - at 70B parameters, Chinchilla beat Gopher (280B) by virtue of having a 4X larger training set. This suggests that a PaLM-style model could be made even more powerful if it was trained on substantially more data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why this matters: Language models are basically a new sub-field of AI, and papers like this show how, despite being expensive and resource-intensive, simply scaling them up can lead to quite profound jumps in capability. We also don't know where the limits of scale like - on the (deliberately hard) BIG-Bench benchmark, the authors find that \"PaLM’s performance as a function of scale follows a log-linear behavior similar to prior models, suggesting that performance improvements from scale have not yet plateaued.\" The future is going to be very strange, and it's arriving very quickly. \n",

      "Robots, as we all know, are pretty dumb. They can do highly specific, repeatable things if their environment doesn't change (e.g, a Fanuc robot working on a custom-designed production line), but if you vary their environment, they tend to fall apart (or fall over). Now, new research from Google shows that you can staple a really big language model to a real world robot and create something that is more than the sum of its parts. Centaur AI, here we come!\n",
      "\n",
      "What they did: The researchers combine two things - a large language model, and a robot which has a load of pre-learned, basic skills paired with perception capabilities (e.g, being able to move to places, or pick up things). A user then asks the robot a question (e.g., I spilled a can of coke, can you clean it), then the robot picks its action based on responses with probabilities scored by the language model, then it explores its environment and uses its inbuilt skills to figure out if something is possible, then you basically times the two things together (the LLM prediction and what the robot thinks is possible) and do whatever is the most likely of the two. This is one of those simple ideas that works surprisingly well in practice (check out the video to see what I mean). \n",
      "\n",
      "How well it does: Overall, this approach yields robots that can plan correctly about 70% of the time (split across a few distinct planning benchmarks), and can execute on average 61% of the time. That's not great, but it's also not terrible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Caveats: Robots are still very, very slow - the videos shared along with the research are run with a 4X speedup. Additionally, the demos are still pretty staged - the robots will put a can of coca cola on top of the bin, but not in it. The experiment was still conducted in a somewhat constrained environment - an office kitchen with 5 predicted locations and 15 objects. In tests, 65% of the errors for the system could be attributed to a language model failure, while 35% came from affordance errors in the robot.\n",

      "AI Ethics Brief by Abhishek Gupta from the Montreal AI Ethics Institute Examining business practices can make AI ethics guidelines more effective  … Fairness, accountability, sustainability, and transparency need to be expanded in scope to include business practices to become more useful …  What does AI ethics really mean? A new research paper looks at 47 sets of AI ethics guidelines coming from corporations, government, multi-stakeholder dialogues, and civil society to figure out what gets prioritized in AI ethics.  Background: The paper analyzes AI ethics failures, such as “ethics shopping” where businesses choose particular ethical things to implement to meet particular business goals, and also cases where they don't implement stuff because it poses a threat to the bottom line.   Fairness and accountability: They find that fairness and accountability in business practices are most well represented in the analyzed guidelines. Under fairness, key themes include open innovation, market fairness, and bias and diversity in professional practices. Under accountability, themes include public perception of business practices, along with internal and external oversight. Those from public and private organizations place more of an emphasis on public perception “in order to legitimize their pursuits of micro- and macro-economic growth.”  Sustainability and transparency: Most guidelines emphasize an interest in “produc[ing] greater benefit and lesser harm in the short- and long-term,” yet they remain vague in how to achieve that. Under transparency, themes that emerged include scope of decision-making explanation, transparent business practices and culture, and documentation, disclosure, and selective transparency. Most guidelines focus heavily on explaining the technical aspects of a given AI system “rather than the business rationale for developing and operating the system.”  Why it matters: The paper makes a call for more detail (and rightly so!) in the principles and guidelines, especially when it comes to business practices because they form a core component of the social and political economy within which AI systems will be designed, developed, and deployed. As the authors say, “there can be no ethical AI without ethical businesses to build it,” we need to now approach these principles and guidelines with a view towards applying them to business model, practices, and decision-making design to achieve the stated goals of these guidelines in practice.     Read more: The Ethics of AI Business Practices: A Review of 47 AI Ethics Guidelines (SSRN).  \n",

      " Chinese researchers plan to train vast models - and it's not the private sector doing it:\n",
      "…'Big Model' paper represents a statement of intent. We should pay attention…\n",
      "A massive group of Chinese-affiliated researchers have published a position paper about large-scale models. The paper is interesting less for what it says (it's basically an overview of large-scale models and pretty similar to Stanford's 'Foundation Models' paper), but more for what it signals: namely, that well resourced government-linked researchers in China want to build some really big models. The position in the paper contrasts with that in the West, where big models are mostly built by the private sector, while being critiqued by the academic sector (and increasingly worked on, albeit via access schemes).  Main point: \"Big Models will Change the AI Research Paradigm and Improve the Efficiency of Researches,\" the researchers write. \"In this ecosystem, big models will be in the position of operating systems or basic development platforms.\" Paper authors: Authors include researchers affiliated with the Beijing Academy of AI, Tsinghua University, Wechat, Northeastern University*, Renmin University, Peking University, Huawei,  Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Chinese Academy of Science, JD AI Research, Harbin Institute of Technology, Columbia University*, Bytedance, Microsoft Research Asia*, Mila*, New York University*, and BeiHang University. \n",
      "*Things that make you make a geopolitical 'hmmmm' sound: The paper includes a bunch of academics affiliated with Western institutions (e.g, Microsoft, Mila, NYU), but all those authors have an asterisk next to their name saying \"Produced by Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence\". In other words, it's signaling that despite their affiliations, they're doing this work at the Chinese government-backed BAAI research institution.  We should take this as a statement of intent: Many of the authors on this paper have previously built large-scale models, ranging from the trillion+ parameter MoE 'WuDao' model, to the more recent research on trying to build training frameworks capable of scaling up to 100 trillion+ parameter MoE models (Import AI 288). Therefore, this isn't like Stanford (which currently lacks the engineering resources to train massive scale models), it's much more like a statement of intent from a big private lab, like a Microsoft or a Google.     But the twist here is that BAAI is wired into both the Chinese government and academic ecosystem, so if the authors of this paper end up building large-scale models, the models will be distributed much more evenly throughout China's AI ecosystem, rather than gatekeeper. The implications of this are vast in terms of safety, development of the Chinese AI industry, and potential ways in which Chinese AI research may diverge from Western AI research.\n",

Concretely, they find that by training a model called Chinchilla on 1.4 trillion tokens of data, they can dramatically beat the performance of larger models (e.g, Gopher) which have been trained on smaller datasets (e.g, 300 billion tokens). Another nice bonus is models trained in this way are cheaper to fine-tune on other datasets and sample from, due to their small size.\n",

      "#################################################### AI Ethics Brief by Abhishek Gupta from the Montreal AI Ethics Institute How can we strengthen the EU AI Act to meaningfully regulate AI? … Empowering those affected, ex-post monitoring, moving beyond individual risks to systemic and environmental risks, amongst more …  Researchers from the UK's Ada Lovelace Institute have proposed 18 recommendations that, if adopted, could broaden the scope of the EU AI Act to incorporate more indirect harms. Their proposals would extend the meaning of risks beyond individual freedoms and rights to systemic and environmental concerns, alter how the act approaches questions of governance. Scope and definitions: The key contribution here involves including “those affected” by AI systems as a critical stakeholder in governance and risk assessment aspects of the EU AI Act. While users are included, those affected don’t usually have much agency in how they are subject to the outcomes of these systems; including them as a part of the Act will help strengthen the protection of fundamental rights.  Unacceptable risks and prohibited AI practices: The current risk categorization is quite narrow and limited. The Ada Lovelace Institute proposes expanding it to consider the “reasonably foreseeable purpose of an AI system” beyond just the “intended purpose” as put forth by the manufacturer. The rationale behind this is that it will encourage deeper reflection on how harm can manifest in practice, a little bit akin to the Broader Impact Statements requirement for conference submissions. Another idea they propose is something called a “reinforced proportionality test” so that systems that might pose “unacceptable risks” are only deployed when they meet a higher standard rather than the one set out in the Act right now. Governance and implementation: The recommendations call for the inclusion of redress from individuals/legal entities affected by AI systems to raise complaints and receive reasonable responses. To ensure that this requirement can be met, the recommendations make the case for granting the Market Surveillance Authorities to be given more resources to support such mechanisms.  Why it matters: Regulations coming out of Europe tend to have spillover effects around the world and thus getting the EU AI Act, one of the first targeted and wide-ranging regulations for AI systems, well done will be important. What will be interesting to see is how much of a transformation can be achieved by recommendations being made by organizations such as ALI amongst others in getting the EU AI Act into better shape before it is adopted and enforced. Just as the GDPR has been flagged for concerns in not being able to meet emerging requirements for AI systems, we have an opportunity to address some pitfalls that we see on the road ahead instead of having to scramble to fix these issues post-enactment.     Read more: People, risk and the unique requirements of AI (Ada Lovelace Institute). ####################################################\n",

      "…Another little tip-toe into language model deployment…\n",
      "Google has put language model-powered text summarization into Google Docs, in another sign of the economic relevance of large-scale generative models. Specifically, Google has recently used its Pegasus model for abstractive summarization to give Google Doc users the ability to see short summaries of their docs.\n",
      "\n",
      "What they did: The main components here are the data, where Google \"fine-tuned early versions of our model on a corpus of documents with manually-generated summaries that were consistent with typical use cases\", and also \"carefully cleaned and filtered the fine-tuning data to contain training examples that were more consistent and represented a coherent definition of summaries.\". Google fine-tuned its Pegasus model on this data, then used knowledge distillation to \"distill the Pegasus model into a hybrid architecture of a Transformer encoder and an RNN decoder\" to make it cheaper to do inference off of. It serves this model via Google-designed TPUs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Challenges: Summarization is a hard task even for contemporary AI models. Some of the challenges Google has encountered include distributional issues, where \"our model only suggests a summary for documents where it is most confident\", meaning Google needs to collect more data to further improve performance, as well as open questions as to how to precisely evaluate the quality of summarizations. More pertinently for researchers, Google struggles to summarize long documents, despite these being among the most useful things for the system to summarize.\n",

In a lengthy, recently published report, the agency tries to think through the multilayered problem that is bias in AI.  Three types of bias: NIST says AI has three categories of bias - systemic, statistical, and human. Systemic biases are the historical, societal, and institutional biases which are encoded into the world. Statistical bias are the forms of bias that come from running AI software (e.g, bias from data selection, bias from machine learning algorithms, etc). Human biases are all the (many) biases that humans exhibit in their day to day lives.\n",

      "Large language models: One of the notable parts of the report is that it specifically focuses on large language models (e.g, GPT-3) at a few points; it's quite rare to see a wonky government document display such familiarity with contemporary technology. The report notes that the ways we benchmark these models today are pretty crappy. \"Methods for capturing the poor performance, harmful impacts and other results of these models currently are imprecise and non-comprehensive,\" the report writes. \"Although LLMs have been able to achieve impressive advances in performance on a number of important tasks, they come with significant risks that could potentially undermine public trust in the technology.\"\n",

      "  They have two main insights:\n",
      "  First: Across all benchmarks, there are three typical patterns enroute to achieving state-of-the-art - continuous growth (e.g, ImageNet saw fairly steady improvement), saturation/stagnation (e.g, benchmarks like CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 have become saturated and stagnated in recent years), and stagnation followed by a burst (e.g, the PROTEINS benchmark which saw a dramatic jump recently).  \n",
      "  Second: Across all 1688 benchmarks, only 1111 (66%) have three or more results reported at different time points. That's a problem - it suggests about 33% of the benchmarks being made are functionally useless.  What this all means: Zooming out, they find that there's been significant progress in AI in recent years, with computer vision benchmarks getting a lot of attention in the first half of the previous decade, followed by a boom in benchmark creation in natural language processing. \"Establishment of novel benchmarks was reduced in 2020, and concentrated on high-level tasks associated with inference and reasoning, likely because of increasing model capabilities in these areas,\" they also write.\n",

      "Researchers with ed-tech startup Korbit, MILA, and the University of Bath have explored how much of a difference AI makes in education. Specifically, they tested the difference in educational outcomes between students who were studying up on data science via a MOOC online course, and students who were studying the same subject via an AI-infused personalized tutor built by Korbit. The results are startling: \"We observe a statistically significant increase in the learning outcomes, with students on Korbit providing full feedback achieving learning gains 2-2.5 times higher than both students on the MOOC platform and a control group of students who don’t receive personalized feedback on the Korbit platform,\" they write.\n",
      "\n",
      "How AI makes a difference: The main difference here is personalization. On Korbit, \"if a student’s solution is incorrect, the system responds with one of a dozen different pedagogical interventions to help students arrive at the correct solution to the problem. Such pedagogical interventions on the Korbit platform include, among others, hints, explanations, elaborations, mathematical hints, concept tree diagrams, and multiple choice quiz answers.  The type and the levels of difficulty for each pedagogical intervention is chosen by RL models based on the student’s learning profile and previous solution attempts.\"\n",

In China, that's not the case. New research from Tsinghua University, Alibaba Group, Zhejiang Lab, and the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence shows how Chinese researchers are trying to train trillion+ parameter models on a domestic supercomputer, using domestic processors. This kind of research is important for two reasons: first, it shows the ambitions of Chinese researchers to train what they call 'brain-scale' (aka, very big!) models. Second, it highlights how in China there's a lot more work going on oriented around collaborative scale-up projects between the government, academia, and the private sector - something that basically never happens in the US.\n",
      "  What they did: Here, the researchers develop a training framework to help them develop trillion+ scale mixture-of-experts model. They train a 1.93 trillion model as well as validating that their system can scale to 14.5 trillion and 174 trillion (not a typo!) models. The paper is basically an engineering summary of the work it took to train the models at this scale while saturating the processing capacity of a major Chinese supercomputer, the New Generation Sunway Supercomputer. \"We are the first to investigate mixed-precision training in brain scale pretrained models.

Why this matters: AI is industrializing. But a lot of the secret sauce for large-scale model training is currently kept inside a tiny number of private companies. This is dangerous - it means a tiny set of organizations control the talent pipeline for large-scale training, and the longer this goes on, the more irrelevant universities become for developing insights at the large-scale frontier. Initiatives like this from China show how we could live in a different world - one where teams from governments, universities, and companies work together, creating a shared base of knowledge around this training, and ultimately building a muscle that can be repurposed for economic or national security.\n",

      "AI Ethics Brief by Abhishek Gupta from the Montreal AI Ethics Institute Now that GitHub Copilot has been out for some time, where does the open source community stand on it? … Both the development and deployment of Copilot might implicate codecreators’ copyrights, though the “fair use” doctrine might negate this… \n",
      "People who incorporate code generated via GitHub copilot are probably not infringing on the original code creators' copyright, according to research from Wayne State University and UC Berkeley. Legal background: The researchers note that under the Copyright Act (USA), “[o]riginal code is automatically protected by copyright as soon as it is written and saved to some tangible medium.” This mostly revolves around  “fair use” which is determined by a four-part test: (1) purpose and character of use, (2) nature of the copyrighted work, (3) how much of the copyrighted work is used, and (4) the economic effect of the use on the copyright owner.  Legal analysis: Under the Terms of Service of GitHub, the company is allowed to “copy [code] to our database and make backups”, “show it to you and to other users”, and “parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers.” Training Copilot might be a form of analysis, but some courts might find that this is an unanticipated new use of technology that isn’t made explicitly clear in the license. Some others might find that the use of Copilot will lead to the creation of derivative works and that the license doesn’t specifically allow for that. The authors point out though that “[c]aselaw on this point is sparse.” The 4-part test from the Copyright Act: Under the “purpose and character of use”, there is a strong argument to be made that Copilot is a transformative use of the underlying code and even the verbatim snippets generated are unlikely to supersede the original repository. Under the “nature of copyrighted work,” since Copilot allows users to create new programs more easily rather than just replicate functionality, it would fall under “fair use.” Under “how much of the copyrighted work is used,” the purpose of the copying is what determines permissible limits, and the authors make the case that without copying the entire codebase for training, Copilot won’t achieve effectiveness, and hence the amount of copying could be justified. For the final part, given how transformative the work is, the new work won’t be a strong market substitute for the original, and hence, the economic effect of the use on the copyright owner will not be large. Also, drawing from the FAQ of Copilot, the authors substantiate this by saying, “copying would perforce amount to copying of ideas rather than expression, and would not be infringing.” Why it matters: The paper raises interesting IP-related questions as we have ever-larger language models with a very broad scope of capabilities. As the authors point out, at the very least, the proliferation of Copilot is making developers become more aware of IP issues and the potential issues that might arise in hosting code publicly. We need more research that brings together legal and technical experts to get to the heart of addressing these issues meaningfully.     Read more: Copyright Implications of the Use of Code Repositories to Train a Machine Learning Model — Free Software Foundation — Working together for free software.\n",

      "AI Ethics Brief by Abhishek Gupta from the Montreal AI Ethics Institute How do vulnerabilities in AI systems differ from those in the realm of traditional cybersecurity? … several key differences warrant novel disclosure and mitigation approaches as AI systems become more widely deployed …  Researchers from the Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET) at Georgetown University have summarized how computer security differs between traditional software and AI.  Differences: ML vulnerabilities can remain unfixed by vendors for reasons like (1) unjustifiable high costs, (2) fixes not possible, (3) performance drops, or (4) a fix can lead to other vulnerabilities opening up. In instances where the ML system has been customized for the end-user, vulnerabilities might be unique to that user and a broad patch might not be applicable. Most exploits in this domain have limited real-world applicability outside of a lab setting and hence they are more useful as warnings rather than viable threats. Trends in handling vulnerabilities: These differences mean that there will likely be fewer patches available for ML systems, and that if vendors are unwilling (or unable) to fix vulnerabilities, then the burden falls on the users of these systems to better understand the risks that they take on. Some steps we can take: We should carry out more analysis of the real-world capabilities of malicious actors to exploit these vulnerabilities in practice, then share this knowledge to help create more effective mitigation strategies.  Why it matters: The fact that some vulnerabilities might be unique to some users makes it difficult to develop and distribute patches in a reliable manner. Given the inherent stochasticity of ML systems, exploits will need to clear a much higher bar if they are going to be effective demonstrations of vulnerability in ML systems, rather than an example of a peculiar or idiosyncratic implementation of a given system. The security community may also need to reprioritize towards meeting the needs of users rather than vendors in vulnerability disclosure and redressal is warranted for ML systems. More so, investments in red teaming for ML (as is the case at organizations like Microsoft, Meta, etc.) will also help to move from lab to real-world exploitation more effectively.    Read more: Securing AI (CSET).\n",

      "Generative adversarial networks make phony photorealistic images—and now synthetic data, too A recent survey has revealed that 99 percent of computer-vision engineers have had a machine-learning project completely canceled due to insufficient training data. Researchers have already been looking toward synthetic data to fill this breach. In fact, Gartner foresees that by 2024, more than half of data used for AI and analytics projects will be synthetically generated. A research group from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has explored whether, given that generative models are now capable of producing highly realistic images, they can replace data sets to train computer-vision AI models. In their paper presented at the 2022 International Conference on Learning Representations, the MIT researchers asked whether, “given access only to a trained generative model, and no access to the dataset that trained it, can we learn effective visual representations?” As generative models, specifically generative adversarial networks (GANs), get better and better, researchers are indeed getting performance close to that of real data for learning representations, says Ali Jahanian, a research scientist at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), and one of the authors of the paper. GANs are deep-learning models that use two neural networks working against each other—a generator that creates synthetic data, and a discriminator that distinguishes between real and synthetic data—to generate synthetic images that are almost indistinguishable from real ones. GANs are popular for generating images and videos, including deepfakes. The research used these pretrained models for multiview representation learning. “Their method uses a contrastive objective that pushes the model to produce a presentation that’s similar for different views of the same object,” says Anna Rumshisky, a computer scientist at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell. Jahanian and his colleagues’ study is a valuable proof of concept showing that applying contrastive methods to synthetic data allows the model to learn well without having the data set, she adds. On some specific tasks, GANs are able to outperform real data when used for a downstream transfer learning task. For example, Nvidia’s StyleGAN can disentangle color from the objects and can even rotate the objects. “Because it is not only learning the data,\" he says, “but also the transformations.” \n",
      "\n",
      "MIT researchers have demonstrated the use of a generative machine-learning model to create synthetic data, based on real data, that can be used to train another model for image classification. This image shows examples of the generative model’s transformation methods.MIT Synthetic data has some advantages over traditional data sets, the researchers note. For instance, not all research teams have the resources to access high-volume, high-quality data, especially when it could involve sensitive information, such as personal data. In that case, pretrained generative models can be more efficient and accessible. Synthetic data is useful to simulate conditions that may not (yet) exist. These data sets can also be edited, and potentially at scale. This allows researchers to, for example, remove biases that exist in real data sets. Developing methods to control what the model is generating is an active research area, says Rumshisky. Speaking from the point of view of natural language processing, which is her area of expertise, she adds, “There's been quite a few efforts in the past three years to come up with models that allow you to control what's getting generated…to push them all towards generating certain kinds of keywords, or certain kinds of attributes.” If you had a mechanism to control the attributes of the text that the model is generating, she explains, you could perhaps push it away from generating certain kinds of data, such as, personal details like names, social security numbers, and phone numbers, for instance. The real test is whether the performance of ML models trained on synthetic data are on par with those trained on real data. That is still a work in progress at this stage. “I am using these models on data that, for instance, comes from self-driving vehicle data,” Jahanian says. “Eventually we want the AI agent to be able to go to the real world and…solve [real] tasks.” There is still a long road ahead for generative data sets, Jahanian says. “A good question that was asked recently [was]: If these [generative] models are already biased, would we [get] biased representations? And I think that one future work would be…[to look] at the representations and see to what extent they are biased and how can we unbias them.” Jahanian says bias implicit in the GANs themselves is another concern. Does a biased GAN necessarily yield biased representations? Another issue, he adds, concerns how realistic the synthetic data sets might be—and possibly how they might mislead a neural net into normalizing something that isn’t normal. “With real data, you probably cannot generate a view where a person is running with their dog in the middle of highway,” he says. “But to what extent can you do that using a generative model if it is not already seen in the underlying data? So this is a question that I’m trying to work on.” The AI pioneer says it’s time for smart-sized, “data-centric” solutions to big issues  Andrew Ng was involved in the rise of massive deep learning models trained on vast amounts of data, but now he’s preaching small-data solutions.  Andrew Ng has serious street cred in artificial intelligence. He pioneered the use of graphics processing units (GPUs) to train deep learning models in the late 2000s with his students at Stanford University, cofounded Google Brain in 2011, and then served for three years as chief scientist for Baidu, where he helped build the Chinese tech giant’s AI group. So when he says he has identified the next big shift in artificial intelligence, people listen. And that’s what he told IEEE Spectrum in an exclusive Q&A.                                                      \n",
