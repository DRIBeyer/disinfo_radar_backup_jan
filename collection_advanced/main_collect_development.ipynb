In this and future editions, we will keep you informed of important news, developments, and policies \\nregarding artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomy in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). We welcome \\nyour questions, comments, or subscription requests at chinaai@cna.org. \\n\\nIn our first issue, we spotlight the 13th Zhuhai Airshow, which dominated much of the AI and autonomy \\nnews over the past two weeks. We also cover the PRC government’s issuing of new regulations on \\nalgorithms, standardization, and the export of “core data,” and the setup of new “intelligent social \\ngovernance experimentation bases,” which signal the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP’s) further tightening \\nof regulations on the tech industry. We also report on such topics as the PRC’s AI market share and \\nupcoming AI conferences and events.\\n\\nWe would also like to use this inaugural issue to promote a new CNA report by researchers Kevin Pollpeter \\nand Amanda Kerrigan titled “The PLA and Intelligent Warfare: A Preliminary Analysis.” The report presents \\nPRC perspectives on the integration of AI and autonomy in future warfare activity.\\n\\nSubscribe/Unsubscribe at chinaai@cna.org\\n\\nTHIS WEEK’S CONTENTS\\nSpotlight: Zhuhai Airshow  2\\nOther News 4\\n\\nMilitary and National Security 4\\nAI Policy and Governance 4\\nIndustry 5\\nAI and Autonomy Workforce 6\\nSelf-Driving Cars 6\\nOther Unmanned Vehicles 6\\nData  6\\nEvents 7\\n\\nNotes 7\\n\\nmailto:chinaai@cna.org\\nhttps://www.cna.org/CNA_files/PDF/The-PLA-and-Intelligent-Warfare-A-Preliminary-Analysis.pdf\\nmailto:chinaai@cna.org\\n\\n\\n2\\nWWW.CNA.ORG/CHINA-AI\\n\\nTHE CHINA AI AND AUTONOMY REPORT | ISSUE 1, NOVEMBER 2, 2021 \\n\\nCopyright © 2021 CNA\\n\\nSPOTLIGHT: ZHUHAI AIRSHOW \\nThe PRC held its 13th Zhuhai Airshow, formally known as Airshow China, from September 8 to \\nOctober 3. According to media reports, more than 100 aircraft were on exhibit as well as displays of \\nthe PRC’s next-generation crewed rocket and heavy-lift launch vehicles, unmanned boats, and unmanned \\nground vehicles (UGVs).1 The airshow featured a growing number of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), \\ndemonstrating the PRC’s commitment to becoming a leader in unmanned systems for both domestic \\nuse and export. Quoting People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force experts, the CCP’s official newspaper, \\nPeople’s Daily, stated that the large number of PRC aircraft displayed at the airshow demonstrates that \\nthe PLA Air Force is “crossing the threshold” to becoming a “strategic air force” capable of strategic \\ndeterrence, air and space defense, long-range strike, air control, strategic transport, and supporting land \\nand naval operations.2\\n\\nA new line of drones called “Feihong” (飞鸿) caught Western media attention.3 The Feihong series of \\ndrones is manufactured by the Ninth Academy of the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation \\n(CASC), also known as the China Academy of Aerospace Electronics Technology (中国航天电子技术研\\n究院). CASC is one of two large state-owned conglomerates normally involved in the development and \\nmanufacture of missiles, space-launch vehicles, and satellites. The expansion of CASC into the UAV field \\nthat would normally be dominated by PRC aviation giant Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) \\nlikely indicates the importance placed upon unmanned systems by the PLA and at least a tacit policy to \\nallow competition in an emerging field.\\n\\nAccording to a CASC representative, the Feihong series of drones is a line of “highly autonomous” \\nreconnaissance and strike UAVs that began to be developed in 2005 and has won the first prize of the \\nNational Defense Science and Technology Progress Award.4 The Feihong series of seven drones includes \\nthe FH-901 “airborne swarm system,” a loitering missile that may have been previously known as the CH-\\n901; the FH-902 “single soldier fixed wing UAV,” which appears similar to the US Army’s RQ-11 Raven \\nlightweight unmanned aerial system; the FH-91 reconnaissance UAV; the FH-96 long-range UAV; the FH-\\n92A reconnaissance/strike UAV; and the FH-95 medium/long-range UAV.5 According to Zhang Zhongyang, \\na vice president of CASC, the company plans to market the Feihong series internationally. According to \\nanother source, the FH-92A has been exported to 10 countries, including Serbia.6\\n\\nThe Feihong drone receiving the most attention is the FH-97. Many observers have pointed out the \\nsimilar appearance of the FH-97 to the Kratos XQ-58A Valkyrie, “an experimental stealthy unmanned \\ncombat aerial vehicle designed and built for the US Air Force” as part of a “loyal wingman concept” in \\nwhich effective but lower-cost and attritable UAVs escort crewed aircraft.7\\n\\nAccording to PRC press reporting articles, the FH-97 “adopts a fusion stealth layout” with a distributed \\nsynthetic aperture radar (SAR) and “intelligent skin antenna technology” that provide 360-degree \\noptical and electronic reconnaissance coverage.8 The FH-97 is advertised as being able to operate fully \\nautonomously in denied environments. The FH-97 has a 1,000-kilometer combat radius and a 6-hour \\nloitering capability.9 According to a CASC representative, the FH-97 “can carry different types of weapons, \\nand has swarm and electronic warfare capabilities.”10 \\n\\nIn an apparent comparison to the FH-97, Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post reports that PRC engineers \\nhave assessed that the XQ-58A lacks sufficient aerial combat capabilities and can only withstand 1.7 gs. They \\nnote that maneuverability may have been sacrificed for weapons carriage and surveillance capabilities.11 \\n\\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/chinas-biggest-air-show-display-self-sufficiency-drive-military-prowess-2021-09-26/\\nhttp://military.people.com.cn/n1/2021/1005/c1011-32245885.html\\nhttps://i.ifeng.com/c/8A1BCX4WbrH\\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/china-unveils-loyal-wingman-armed-drone-concept-2021-09-29/\\nhttps://pub-zhtb.hizh.cn/a/202109/29/AP615456f2e4b052b25464a3f4.html\\nhttps://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/37062/china-conducts-test-of-massive-suicide-drone-swarm-launched-from-a-box-on-a-truck\\nhttps://tech.youth.cn/wzlb/202109/t20210929_13243656.htm\\nhttps://www.army-technology.com/projects/rq-11-raven/\\nhttps://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/42555/china-is-cloning-kratos-xq-58a-valkyrie-unmanned-combat-air-vehicle-concept\\nhttps://www.kratosdefense.com/systems-and-platforms/unmanned-systems/aerial/tactical-uavs\\nhttps://www.airforce-technology.com/projects/loyal-wingman-unmanned-aircraft/\\nhttps://tech.youth.cn/wzlb/202109/t20210929_13243656.htm\\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/china-unveils\\nhttps://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_14716469\\nhttps://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3149185/chinese-engineers-say-they-have-found-flaws-latest-us-combat\\n\\n\\n3\\nWWW.CNA.ORG/CHINA-AI\\n\\nTHE CHINA AI AND AUTONOMY REPORT | ISSUE 1, NOVEMBER 2, 2021 \\n\\nCopyright © 2021 CNA\\n\\nCASC’s commitment to UAVs was also demonstrated by the static display of the Caihong (Rainbow) 6. \\nThis was the first time that a full-scale mockup of the CH-6 was displayed at the airshow. The Drive carried \\nextensive analysis of the CH-6, describing it as “a long-endurance, twin-jet engine, multirole drone” \\nintended for reconnaissance and strike roles.12 \\n\\nIn addition to listing the performance capabilities of the CH-6, the China-Arms.com website states that \\nthe CH-6 “can conduct high-altitude reconnaissance and strike, maritime anti-submarine and patrol, long-\\nrange early warning and detection, and close air support” with a “variety of loads such as electro-optical, \\nSAR, early warning radar, electronic reconnaissance, air-to-ground missiles, air-to-ground bombs, anti-\\nradiation missiles, and small- and medium-sized cruise bombs.”13 \\n\\nAVIC was also represented at the airshow with its line of “Wuzhen” (unmanned reconnaissance/无\\n侦) UAVs. Drawing attention was the WZ-8. According to the China-Arms.com website, AVIC describes \\nthe WZ-8 as “‘a high-altitude, high-speed unmanned reconnaissance aircraft’ used for reconnaissance and \\nbattle damage assessment that can also conduct ‘suicide’ attacks against targets.” The WZ-8 can be carried \\nby HN-6 bombers and is powered by two rocket engines that enable it to reach speeds up to Mach 3 and \\noperate at “near-space” altitudes.14\\n\\nAVIC also displayed a mockup of the GJ-11 (Strike/攻击)-11 UAV. According to Defense News, the GJ-\\n11 “is believed to have been derived from AVIC’s Lijian (“Sharp Sword”) demonstrator project but featuring \\na whole host of low-observable improvements such as a blended fuselage and triangular air intake with \\nshielded exhaust nozzles.” The mockup displayed two weapons bays that “were shown carrying four small \\nbombs in the class of the GBU-39/53 Small Diameter Bombs in one of the bays, with the other incorporating \\nwhat appears to be a 454-kilogram or 1,000-lb class weapon.”15\\n\\nCETC Laisi Information System Co.

The company, also known as the CETC 28th Research Institute, is a subsidiary of the PRC \\nstate-owned electronics conglomerate, China Electronics Technology Corporation (CETC). According to a \\nlead researcher, the company developed the military’s first command automation system during the “two \\nbombs, one satellite” program that produced the PRC’s first nuclear weapons, ballistic missile, and satellite. \\nThe company is now involved in the development, production, maintenance, and service of command \\ninformation systems for all services. Described as an “R2D2”-type system for pilot commanders, it provides \\ndecision support to pilots during air-to-air combat and can self-learn to adapt to new situations.16\\n\\nAircraft were not the only platforms displayed at the airshow. Unmanned boat manufacturer Zhuhai \\nYunzhou Intelligent Science and Technology Co. Ltd. (珠海云洲智能科技股份有限公司) displayed a number \\nof its unmanned boats. They included the L30 unmanned patrol boat, the M75C unmanned training boat, \\nthe L85A unmanned general purpose boat, and the L90 unmanned underwater detection boat.17 The boats \\nare designed to work in clusters and are described as being able to engage in autonomous decision-making \\nand operate using distributed situational awareness. Zhuhai Yunzhou Intelligent Science and Technology \\nCo.

Based on an analysis of commercial satellite imagery, USNI identified two \\nsuspected USVs moored at the base. One appeared to be a larger version of the “JARI” USV, a 50-foot USV \\nthat was reported to have conducted sea trials in 2020. The new version is 70 feet long. The second USV is \\na catamaran, also approximately 70 feet long.20\\n\\nThe director of the PRC Office of the National Border and Coastal Defense Commission, Wang \\nBin, wrote an article in the CCP’s official newspaper, People’s Daily, on his office’s intentions to build a \\nsmart border and coastal defense system through the use of 5G technology, the Internet of Things, cloud \\ncomputing, and AI. Wang called for the establishment of new policies, the creation of think tanks, and the \\nconstruction of transportation, power, and communications infrastructure to support the effort.21\\n\\nAI POLICY AND GOVERNANCE\\nOn September 26, the PRC published its first guidelines on AI ethics, which emphasize user rights \\nand data control (see original document in Chinese from the MOST website here).22 One of the stated \\ngoals of the guidelines is to ensure that AI is “always under the control of humans.” According to the South \\nChina Morning Post, the guidelines are part of the PRC’s effort to become the global AI leader by 2030, but \\nthey also align with Beijing’s efforts to crack down on Big Tech influence.23 The guidelines were issued by \\nthe National Expert Committee for AI Governance of China, which was established in 2019.24\\n\\nOn September 29, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) and seven other departments \\njointly announced a list of “national intelligent social governance experimentation bases.”25 The bases \\nhave been established to carry out social governance experiments using AI. The announcement identifies \\nvarious PRC provinces, municipalities, and districts to serve as “intelligent social governance experimental \\nbases” on a variety of issues, including city administration, elder care, education, community governance, \\nenvironmental governance, health and sanitation, and sports. The PRC often uses policy experimentation \\nto test out a policy or initiative’s effectiveness in a local setting prior to wider adoption.\\n\\nOn September 29, national and municipal officials held a press conference about Shanghai’s 14th \\nFive-Year Plan to build a science and technology innovation center with global influence.26 The plan \\nhighlights AI as one of the core technologies of focus for Shanghai. In addition, during this period Shanghai \\nis expected to facilitate the deployment of several strategic frontier technologies such as brain-computer \\ninterfaces and brain-like photonic chips. \\n\\nOn September 29, the CAC and eight other departments announced a plan to establish governance \\nrules for algorithms over the next three years (see original document in Chinese here).27 The \\nannouncement highlights that, despite the contributions of algorithms to China’s social development \\nand digital economy, algorithms also affect “the normal communication order, market order, and social \\norder” and “pose challenges to safeguarding ideological security, social fairness and justice, and the \\nlegitimate rights and interests of netizens.” As part of the plan, companies will be supervised to disclose \\nthe basic principles of algorithms and their optimization goals. The plan also seeks “open and transparent” \\nalgorithms and establishes technical teams to evaluate algorithm design. This announcement follows an \\nAugust announcement of draft guidelines for algorithm regulations, which included proposals to allow \\nusers to easily turn off algorithm recommendation services and bar companies from setting up algorithm \\nmodels that tempt users into spending large amounts of money (see original document in Chinese here).28 \\nParallels have been drawn between the PRC’s desire to regulate algorithms and US deliberations to regulate \\ncompanies like Facebook.29\\n\\n4\\n\\nhttps://news.usni.org/2021/10/11/chinese-testing-experimental-armed-drone-ships-at-secret-naval-base\\nhttps://www.maritime-executive.com/article/china-s-unmanned-mini-destroyer-out-on-sea-trials\\nhttp://military.people.com.cn/n1/2021/1011/c1011-32249046.html\\nhttp://www.most.gov.cn/kjbgz/202109/t20210926_177063.html\\nhttps://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3150789/chinese-ai-gets-ethical-guidelines-first-time-aligning-beijings-goal\\nhttps://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3150789/chinese-ai-gets-ethical-guidelines-first-time-aligning-beijings-goal\\nhttps://www.sohu.com/a/297465112_116897\\nhttp://www.cac.gov.cn/2021-09/29/c_1634507963276896.htm\\nhttps://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_14716796\\nhttps://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_14716796\\nhttps://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202109/1235514.shtml\\nhttp://www.cac.gov.cn/2021-09/29/c_1634507915623047.htm\\nhttps://www.reuters.com/technology/china-issues-draft-guidelines-internet-recommendation-algorithms-2021-08-27/\\nhttps://www.reuters.com/technology/china-issues-draft-guidelines-internet-recommendation-algorithms-2021-08-27/\\nhttp://www.cac.gov.cn/2021-08/27/c_1631652502874117.htm\\nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-says-set-governance-rules-algorithms-over-next-three-years-2021-09-29/\\n\\n\\n5\\nWWW.CNA.ORG/CHINA-AI\\n\\nTHE CHINA AI AND AUTONOMY REPORT | ISSUE 1, NOVEMBER 2, 2021 \\n\\nCopyright © 2021 CNA\\n\\nOn September 30, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) published draft \\ndata security regulations that would ban the export of data classified as “core data” (original Chinese \\ntext can be found on the MIIT website here).30 The draft regulations, titled “Opinions on Industrial and \\nInformation Technology Data Security Management (工业和信息化领域数据安全管理办法), categorize data \\ninto three categories: 1) general data, which has limited social impact; 2) vital data, which could threaten the \\nPRC’s territorial, military, economic, societal, cultural, scientific, technological, cyber, ecological, resource, \\nand nuclear safety and China’s overseas interests; and 3) core data, whose loss could seriously threaten \\nnational security and could have major social and economic impacts. Data related to AI would be classified \\nas vital or core, depending on the data. The draft regulations require that all data from the industrial and \\ninformation technology sectors be stored within the PRC, and they also ban core data from leaving the \\ncountry (summary in English from Global Times here).\\n\\nOn October 10, the Central Committee of the CCP and the State Council issued the “Outline for the \\nDevelopment of National Standardization” (国家标准化发展纲), which aims to develop and strengthen \\nstandards across a variety of industries and fields, including AI. The Outline calls for establishing \\nresearch standardization in the fields of AI, information technology, and biotech. It also emphasizes the \\napplication of AI, big data, and Blockchain to improve infrastructure quality and management.31 \\n\\nOn October 13, the general offices of the Central Committee of the CCP and the State Council \\nreleased an opinion on promoting the development of modern vocational education, with AI \\nspecified as a priority area (main content of guidelines can be found in Chinese here).32 The document, \\ntitled “Promoting the High Quality Development of Modern Vocational Education” (推动现代职业教育高\\n质量发展), states that a modern vocational education system should be established in the PRC by 2025, \\nand should be ranked among the best globally by 2035. The article adds that priority should be given \\nto training talent for emerging industries, including advanced manufacturing, renewable energy, modern \\nagriculture, and AI, and that schools should be encouraged to set up majors that meet market demand. A \\nlimited English summary of the article can be found here.33\\n\\nINDUSTRY\\nThe PRC’s AI market increased 24.43 percent to 160.69 billion yuan ($24.955 billion) in 2020. The \\nmarket is expected to increase 26.68 percent to 203.56 billion yuan (US $31.61 billion) by the end of \\n2021, according to a member of the PRC’s State Council speaking at the Chinese Congress on Artificial \\nIntelligence (CCAI) 2021 held in Chengdu. The PRC also leads in the number of AI patent applications \\nfiled globally. More than 480,000 patent applications were filed in the PRC out of 910,000 patent filings \\nglobally. The majority of patent filings focused on electronic equipment, big data, robots, neural networks, \\ncomputers, deep learning, and databases. The top 10 patent applicants in the PRC are Tencent Technology, \\nPing An Technology, Beijing Baidu Netcom Technology, Huawei Technologies, Guangdong OPPO Mobile \\nCommunications, Baidu Online Network Technology (Beijing), State Grid Corporation of China, BOE \\nTechnology Group, Zhejiang University, and Tsinghua University.\\n\\nZhejiang leads the PRC’s smart security, smart retail, smart manufacturing, and smart computing \\nsectors and also is a leader in AI chips, AI software, and Blockchain technology, according to the \\n“2021 Zhejiang Artificial Intelligence Industry Development Report.” The report was issued jointly by \\nthe Zhejiang Provincial Development and Reform Commission and the Provincial Department of Science \\nand Technology (see original version in Chinese here). Contradicting the figures from the CCAI, cited above, \\nthe report shows that the total revenue of the AI industry in Zhejiang Province in 2020 was 269.343 billion \\nyuan (USD$41.900 billion), an increase of 11.99 percent year on year; the total profit was 33.741 billion \\nyuan (USD$5.25 billion), an increase of 14.84 percent year on year. The report further states that Zhejiang \\nseeks to accelerate the construction of major AI-related projects such as the Alibaba Yangtze River Delta \\nIntelligent Data Center and a batch of projects from video surveillance company Hikvision. Zhejiang \\nprovince is an important PRC tech hub, as it is the home of tech giants such as Alibaba and NetEase.34 \\n\\nhttps://www.miit.gov.cn/gzcy/yjzj/art/2021/art_dcb6cc8d9f5c414eabd7070871996525.html\\nhttps://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202109/1235543.shtml\\nhttp://www.gov.cn/zhengce/2021-10/10/content_5641727.htm\\nhttp://www.gov.cn/zhengce/2021-10/10/content_5641727.htm\\nhttp://cpc.people.com.cn/n1/2021/1013/c64387-32251579.html\\nhttp://www.china.org.cn/china/2021-10/13/content_77805401.htm\\nhttps://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_14872604\\nhttp://zj.ifeng.com/c/8AGJzpImRTy\\n\\n\\n6\\nWWW.CNA.ORG/CHINA-AI\\n\\nTHE CHINA AI AND AUTONOMY REPORT | ISSUE 1, NOVEMBER 2, 2021 \\n\\nCopyright © 2021 CNA\\n\\nA Megvii driver was sentenced to four years in prison for attempting to extort Megvii CEO Yin Qi.35 \\nThe driver wanted RMB 3 million yuan (USD$465,860) in exchange for not selling sensitive recordings to \\ncompetitors.
